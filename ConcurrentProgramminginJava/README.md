Concurrent programming enables developers to efficiently and correctly mediate the use of shared resources in parallel programs.
I have used basic concurrency constructs in Java such as threads, locks, critical sections, atomic variables, isolation, actors,
optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections, as well as their theoretical foundations 
(e.g., progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability).

### Skills Gained:
- Algorithms

### The desired learning outcomes of this course are as follows:

- Concurrency theory: progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability
- Use of threads and structured/unstructured locks in Java
- Atomic variables and isolation
- Optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections in Java (e.g., concurrent queues, concurrent  hashmaps)
- Actor model in Java
