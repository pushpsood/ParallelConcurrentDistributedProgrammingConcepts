you can start reading the details below.

Parallel programming enables developers to use multicore computers to make their applications run faster by using 
multiple processors. I have used popular parallel Java frameworks (such as ForkJoin, Stream, and Phaser) to 
write parallel programs that can run on a wide range of multicore platforms including servers, desktops, or mobile 
devices.
